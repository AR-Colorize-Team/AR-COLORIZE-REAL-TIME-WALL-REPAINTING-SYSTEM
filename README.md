## AR COLORIZE - Real-Time Wall Repainting System
An Augmented Reality application that enables real-time visualization of wall color changes using computer vision and AR technology, allowing users to virtually paint walls and visualize color choices before actual painting.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
AR COLORIZE Real-Time Wall Repainting System is an innovative project that leverages augmented reality and computer vision to revolutionize the interior design and painting industry. The system uses advanced image processing techniques to detect wall surfaces in real-time through a camera feed and applies virtual color overlays, enabling users to visualize different paint colors on their walls instantly. Traditional painting decisions require physical samples or imagination, which can lead to costly mistakes. This project addresses this challenge by providing an interactive AR interface that allows users to experiment with unlimited color combinations and see realistic results before making any physical changes to their space.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Real-time wall detection using computer vision algorithms.
- Augmented Reality color overlay on detected wall surfaces.
- Interactive color palette with multiple color options.
- Live camera feed processing with minimal latency.
- User-friendly web-based interface for easy interaction.
- Support for multiple wall surfaces and lighting conditions.
- Color persistence and comparison features.
- Export and save functionality for design choices.
