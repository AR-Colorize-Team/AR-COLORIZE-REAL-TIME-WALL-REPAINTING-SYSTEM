# 🎨 AR Wall Repainting System 🖌️

## ✨ Project Aim

Our project, the **AR Wall Repainting System**, aims to revolutionize the way users visualize and plan home or office wall repainting projects. By leveraging Augmented Reality (AR) technology, we empower users to virtually "paint" their walls with various colors and textures in real-time, directly through their smartphone or tablet camera. This eliminates uncertainty, reduces decision fatigue, and streamlines the entire repainting process from conceptualization to booking.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

Traditional wall repainting involves several challenges:
1.  **Uncertainty in Color/Texture Choice:** Users struggle to visualize how a particular paint color or texture will look on their actual walls under different lighting conditions, leading to dissatisfaction or costly repaints.
2.  **Trial and Error:** Reliance on physical paint swatches is cumbersome and often doesn't provide a realistic impression, necessitating multiple trips to stores and sample purchases.
3.  **Lack of Professional Guidance:** Many users lack design expertise and find it difficult to choose complementary colors or suitable textures for their spaces.
4.  **Inefficient Planning & Quotation:** Getting accurate quotes and planning for a repainting job can be time-consuming and involve multiple site visits before any work begins.

## ✅ Advantages

Our AR Wall Repainting System offers significant advantages:
* **Real-time Visualization:** See paint colors and textures applied instantly to your walls through AR, enabling confident decision-making.
* **Reduced Risk & Cost:** Minimize the risk of choosing the wrong color, saving time, money, and avoiding project delays.
